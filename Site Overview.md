# Reference Site Overview

This site is intended to provide supplemental information to assist you in CS 202, CPE 301, and CS 491/691.

> This site is very much a work in progress!

## Obtaining a Local Copy and Contributing
This site is actually a published [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)vault, with all the files stored in Github. If you wish to have your own local copy, or even better, contribute to the site, you can clone the site [here](https://github.com/klancaster-unr/obsidian-site). To contribute, you add files or make changes to existing files, and then push to Github and issue a pull request. In order to push, you must make your own branch in git, as you cannot push your files directly to the master branch.
