#### Microcontrollers

All microcontrollers (AVR, PIC, ARM cortex M, ESP, 8051) work the same way: registers control peripherals, they move data around by reading and writing to peripherals, commands/programs are stored and executed moving data between peripherals.

We'll be comparing the ATmega 2560 and the ESP32

## ATmega2560


<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Advantages</b></p>

+ Low power consumption with fast start-up
+ Easier to use, with 8-bit microcontroller being less complex than 32/64 bit versions
+ Write/Erase Cycles: 10,000 Flash
+ Power-on Reset and Programmable Brown-out Detection
+ Six Sleep Modes: Idle, ADC Noise Reduction, Power-save, Power-down, Standby, and Extended Standby
+ External and Internal Interrupt Sources

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Disadvantages</b></p>

+ Limited amount of flash memory write cycles restricts the number of times images can be flashed when programmed to pc
+ Naturally lacks incremental performance compared to higher bit microcontrollers

#### Arduino Mega 2560 Board

<br>
<br>

Atmega 2560 is commonly found in the Arduino Mega 2560 as its main microcontroller. Arduino Mega 2560 is an all-around good option. Thereâ€™s no denying that this board brings performance with the running of an ATmega2560, but it provides a substantial number of I/O pins and program space as well.

## ESP32


<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Advantages</b></p>

+ Low Power: ensures that you can still use ADC conversions, for example, during deep sleep.
+ You can program the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE using the Arduino core.
+ Wireless connectivity WiFi: 150.0 Mbps data rate with HT40
+ Bluetooth: BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and Bluetooth Classic
+ Security: hardware accelerators for AES and SSL/TLS
+ Build-in sensors

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Disadvantages</b></p>

+ Can use more power usually when starting up a wi-fi connection, though can be turned off
+ ESP32 boards tend to be smaller than others which may be inconvenient or convenient depending on the developer

#### ESP32 DEV KIT DOIT

The ESP32 microcontroller can be found on many development boards, among them is the ESP32 DEV KIT DOIT. The larger version of this board comes with 36 GPIO pins. The pins are labeled at the top of the board making them easy to read. It also comes with an onboard reset button as well as a BOOT button. Standardly, it also has a USB-to-UART interface to easily program it using the Arduino IDE

## Final Thoughts

The ATMega 2560 is comparable to the ESP32 in terms of basic functionality such as for interaction between buttons, LEDS, chips, motors, etc. Both microcontrollers also use relatively low power.

In terms of affordability, the ESP32 has the upper hand as it can be found for a cheaper price when integrated onto the ESP32 DEV KIT DOIT (~ $20) than the ATmega 2560 on the Mega 2560 board (~ $30).

When it comes to GPIO pins, the Mega 2560 board with the ATmega 2560 chip is better as it has more pins. The ESP32 DEV KIT DOIT only has 36 pins on the larger board option.

In my opinion, I think the Arduino Mega 2560 containing the ATmega 2560 is the better option for the learning experience in the classroom domain. Having additional pins and an overall easier to use experience is exactly what is needed in the classroom. In my research, I also found that there are more resources available online for the ATmega 2560 and so it's better in that aspect as well. One of the key disadvantages to the Atmega 2560 is not being able to use wi-fi or Bluetooth which is a big drawback. So, if wi-fi or Bluetooth is a core requirement of your program, an ESP32 with an appropriate development board might be a better option!
